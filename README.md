## Description
Chess 2 is a combination of the classic game and a comedic 3D animation style. 
A chess board is monitored by a camera while two people play a game. 
Whenever a piece is moved, the camera takes a picture of the current board layout and tracks where the pieces have moved.
After the picture has been taken, the program makes sure that a valid move has been made.
When the move has been validated, a 3D chess board and pieces are updated to reflect the current game being played.
The 3D replica of the current game allows for a variety of improvements to the classic game of chess.
The main highlight of Chess 2 is its capture animations, which play after a capture move has been made and validated by the program.
These comedic videos offer a much more engaging reward for making strategic captures than simply taking a piece out of play.
